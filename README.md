# traffic_light_system
this project is made for the Embedded systems course ASU university 
it's done by a group of 4 students including me 
**Assumtions**
The pedestrian traffic light corresponding to the car traffic light currently red will be green thought out this period
As soon as the pedestrian press the button the car traffic light must turn red. (It would be more logical to turn yellow first; however, it was not stated)
